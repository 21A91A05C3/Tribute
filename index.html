            Gautama Buddha is mentioned as an Avatar of Vishnu in the Puranic texts of Hinduism. In the Bhagavata Purana he is twenty fourth of twenty five avatars, prefiguring a forthcoming final incarnation. A number
                 of Hindu traditions portray Buddha as the most recent of ten principal avatars, known as the Dashavatara .Siddhartha Gautama's teachings deny the authority of the Vedas and consequently  Buddhism is generally 
                 viewed as a nāstika school  from the perspective of orthodox Hinduism.<p>

            <p>The story of the Buddha is an ode to the almost superhuman effort the Buddha made to achieve his liberation, 
                the almost infinite patience it took, and the deep love and compassion that led him to share this path with others.
                The emphasis is on ‘almost’ because his life story is ultimately a human story. The Buddha was not a god, not a being 
                supernatural from birth. No, the Buddha was essentially a human being, like you and me.</p>

            <div class="b2"><p><strong>The term Buddha literally means enlightened one, a knower.</strong> <br><br>
                Buddha is not a name, but a title. It is a Sanskrit word that means “a person who is awake.” What a buddha is awake to is the true nature of reality.

            Simply put, Buddhism teaches that we all live in a fog of illusions created by mistaken perceptions and “impurities” — hate, greed, ignorance.</p>
